# bannerweb-fetch

Scripts for scraping SabancÄ± University course schedules from https://bannerweb.sabanciuniv.edu. A GitHub Actions workflow is configured to run these scripts every day and update the `gh-pages` branch automatically. The aim is to provide an easily accessible and predictable data format for other students who want to build their own tools using the course schedule data.
